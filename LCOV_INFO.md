# LCOV Format Abbreviations

The LCOV format is a textual representation of code coverage data, typically
generated by test coverage tools. It provides detailed information about which
parts of the code have been executed during testing. Understanding these
abbreviations is crucial for interpreting coverage reports effectively.

## Abbreviations Explained

- **TN (Test Name)**

  - **Description**: Specifies the name of the test. This is often left empty,
    indicating no specific test name is provided.
  - **Example**: `TN:`

- **SF (Source File)**

  - **Description**: Indicates the source file being covered. It specifies the
    path to the file relative to the project root.
  - **Example**: `SF:src/App.tsx`

- **FN (Function Name)**

  - **Description**: Lists functions in the source file with their starting line
    numbers. Each function is identified by its name and the line number where
    it starts.
  - **Example**: `FN:9,(anonymous_0)`

- **FNF (Functions Found)**

  - **Description**: The total number of functions found in the file. This
    includes all functions defined in the source file.
  - **Example**: `FNF:3`

- **FNH (Functions Hit)**

  - **Description**: The number of functions that were executed during the test.
    This indicates how many functions were actually called during the test run.
  - **Example**: `FNH:0`

- **FNDA (Function Data)**

  - **Description**: Indicates how many times each function was executed. It
    provides execution counts for each function.
  - **Example**: `FNDA:0,(anonymous_0)`

- **DA (Data for Line)**

  - **Description**: Provides execution data for each line. It specifies the
    line number and how many times that line was executed.
  - **Example**: `DA:9,1`

- **LF (Lines Found)**

  - **Description**: The total number of lines found in the file. This includes
    all executable lines of code.
  - **Example**: `LF:3`

- **LH (Lines Hit)**

  - **Description**: The number of lines that were executed during the test.
    This indicates how many lines were actually run during the test.
  - **Example**: `LH:2`

- **BRF (Branches Found)**

  - **Description**: The total number of branches found in the file. Branches
    are points in the code where execution can follow different paths (e.g.,
    if-else statements).
  - **Example**: `BRF:0`

- **BRH (Branches Hit)**

  - **Description**: The number of branches that were executed during the test.
    This indicates how many branches were actually taken during the test run.
  - **Example**: `BRH:0`

- **BRDA (Branch Data)**

  - **Description**: Provides detailed information about branch coverage. It
    includes the line number, block number, branch number, and how many times
    the branch was taken.
  - **Format**: `BRDA:<line number>,<block number>,<branch number>,<taken>`
  - **Example**: `BRDA:22,0,0,1` indicates that on line 22, in block 0, branch 0
    was taken once.

- **end_of_record**
  - **Description**: Marks the end of the record for this particular source
    file. It separates records for different files in the LCOV report.
  - **Example**: `end_of_record`

## Usage and Importance

- **Purpose**: LCOV data is used to generate coverage reports that help
  developers understand which parts of their code are being tested. This is
  crucial for identifying untested code paths and improving test coverage.
- **Visualization**: Tools like `lcov-report` or `coveralls` can visualize LCOV
  data in a more user-friendly format, making it easier to analyze coverage.
- **Automation**: Integrating LCOV data generation into CI/CD pipelines allows
  teams to automatically track code coverage over time, ensuring that new code
  is adequately tested.

## Example of Generating LCOV Data

To generate LCOV data in a typical JavaScript/TypeScript project using a test
runner like Jest, you can configure Jest to output coverage data in LCOV format:

```json
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageReporters: ['lcov', 'text'],
};
```
